    <h1 class="recipe-name">Black Bean Tostadas</h1>
    <p>Cooking for toddlers is impossible. They're unpredictable, they like something one day and hate it the next... it's crazy. You gain weight as a parent because you're always eating two meals. So I just keep trying new stuff, and sometimes, I'm plesantly surprised by their reaction.</p>

    <p>Who knew that black beans would be such a hit?!? My daughter specifically asks for these now. There's no hot sauce on theirs, and usually they don't want avocado, but who cares? Cheap protein for days! I got the recipe from <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35195090/black-bean-tostada-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Delish.</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 tostadas</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Mexican cheese</li>
        <li>1 avocado, <em>sliced</em></li>
        <li>1 can refried black beans, <em>or you can make your own</em></li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place tostadas on a large baking sheet and sprinkle evenly with cheese. Bake until cheese is melty, about minutes.</li>
        <li>Top tostadas with beans, avocado slices, and hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
