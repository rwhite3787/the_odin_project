    <h1 class="recipe-name">Potato soup</h1>
    <p>I only want soup when it's cold. Why? I don't know. Because it's warm and makes my body warm, and when it's hot in Georgia I don't want to be more hot? You figure it out. It's not important.</p>

    <p>What is important is to know that this soup is good and hearty and great. It's cooked in bacon fat, so that's always a plus. I got the recipe from <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25238472/instant-pot-potato-soup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Delish.</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, <em>cut into 1/2" pieces</em></li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 1/2 lb russet potatoes <em>peeled & cut into 1/2" cubes, about 5 medium</em></li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream, <em>plus more for serving</em></li>
        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese, <em>for serving</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set Instant Pot to "Saut√©" setting. Cook bacon, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a plate, leaving fat in pot.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1 minute more. Pour in broth and stir until flour is dissolved, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes, half-and-half, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine. Cover pot, then set to Pressure Cook on High and set timer for 8 minutes. Slow release pressure.</li>
        <li>Uncover pot and stir in sour cream. Using an immersion blender, blend until some chunky bits of potato remain. Alternatively, you can use a standard blender to blend about half of soup and return to pot.</li>
        <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with more sour cream, bacon, cheddar, and chives.</li>
    </ol>
